Unless otherwise specified, a creature can swallow whole only targets that are at least one size category smaller than itself, and it has room for a single target of that size in its stomach (doubling the maximum number of creatures it can have swallowed for each additional size category by which these creatures are smaller).</p>\n<p>On the creature\u2019s next turn after grappling or pinning the target, if the target has not escaped the grapple or pin, the target automatically takes the attack\u2019s damage at the beginning of the creature\u2019s turn.

If a target cuts its way out of the creature, the creature cannot use swallow whole again until that damage is healed.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, a target swallowed whole can attempt to climb out. The swallowed creature must succeed at both a grapple check against the creature\u2019s internal KAC + 8 and an Athletics check to climb (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 \u00d7 the creature\u2019s CR). Each of these actions takes a full round.
