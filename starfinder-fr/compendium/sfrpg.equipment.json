When activated, the device takes control of your voice, speaking instructions in the artificial language known as Vox. This instruction is concealed inside a conventional Common phrase. A primal voice encoder allows you to use command as a spell-like ability. A sophisticate voice encoder allows you to use suggestion as a spell-like ability. Using a voice encoder is a standard action. You can use a voice encoder once per day, though you can spend 1 Resolve Point to use it again immediately.<br>Before you can use a voice encoder, it must be programmed at a computer that can communicate with the voxbox wirelessly, through a datajack, or some other direct means. Programming a voxbox takes 1 minute. You program the device with the specific command or suggestion, as well as the Common phrase in which the instruction is hidden. (For example, the suggestion \u201cKill Raia Danviri\u201d might be hidden behind the phrase, \u201cI\u2019m from the Stewards. Let me show you my badge.\u201d) Until the voice encoder is reprogrammed, it can be used only to give the chosen command or suggestion, which is always concealed within the same Common phrase.</p"

You can breathe while the field is active, but you can&rsquo;t eat or drink.<br />While a force field is active, you gain a number of temporary Hit Points depending on the force field&rsquo;s power.

A force field has fast healing, meaning that it regains temporary Hit Points at a fixed rate each round at the end of your turn, up to its normal maximum. If the force field&rsquo;s temporary Hit Points are reduced to 0, it is inactive until the end of your next turn, when its fast healing restores some of its Hit Points. The charge capacity, amount of temporary Hit Points granted, and rate of fast healing vary according to the force field&rsquo;s color code. A force field has a usage of 1 charge per round.<br />More powerful force fields also have a fortification ability, which gives a percentage chance that a critical hit is treated as a normal attack, dealing normal damage and not applying any critical effect. You roll your fortification percentage chance before the critical hit&rsquo;s damage is rolled. If a force field is inactive, its fortification ability does not function.

An armor interface comes with a tier 1 computer with an artificial personality and a single control module linked to your armor. You can access this computer without exposing it or yourself to the environment outside of your armor, and you receive information from it through heads-up displays and broadcasts via your armor\u2019s integrated comm unit.<br>With a successful Computers check (DC = the DC needed to hack the computer) you can set the computer to give basic information about your condition (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and so on) to authorized users (which you designate), or to anyone with a medkit, advanced medkit, or medical lab. Characters who can access this information gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Medicine checks they attempt on you.<br>With 10 minutes of work, you can set the computer\u2019s control module to operate any one system in your armor, as long as that system doesn\u2019t take a full action or longer to activate or deactivate. Common applications are environmental protections or a force field armor upgrade. You can set the computer to operate the upgrade at your command (allowing you to activate one such item each round without taking an action to do so), or set it to automatically trigger the system under specific conditions as follows: the first time you take damage, the first time you take Hit Point damage, when you are stunned, when you are staggered, when you are unconscious, or when the atmospheric conditions change. If the trigger occurs, the computer automatically activates the linked system. This occurs at the end of your next turn after the condition occurs. The control module can be linked to weapons or tools that are part of the armor, subject to the normal limitations of control modules (Core Rulebook 215).<br>You can install a higher-tier computer into the computer interface, as long as it has light or negligible bulk. You must pay for the additional computer separately, and installing it requires a successful Computers check with a DC equal to the DC to hack the new computer. The computer cannot have countermeasures that require links to the environment beyond the armor (such as a shock grid) or control modules that control anything other than armor systems, and it cannot activate more than one system each round (even if linked to multiple systems with automatic triggers).</p"
