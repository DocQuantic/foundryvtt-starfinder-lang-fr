A gravity shield is a hybrid item that can mimic the gravity-manipulating powers of copi. You can use a gravity shield to make a special unarmed attack that does not count as archaic and can deal your choice of either bludgeoning or piercing damage.<br />In addition, three times per day as a standard action, you can increase the relative gravity of the shield and attempt a disarm combat maneuver against an adjacent opponent. If you are successful, the disarmed item sticks to your shield for 1 round before it falls to the ground, during which time you can use a swift action to retrieve the item with a free hand. The basic and field gravity shields grant a +1 circumstance bonus to the disarm attack roll and the advanced and elite gravity shields grant a +2 circumstance bonus to the disarm attack roll.</p>"

If the construct fails, your control over it continues until the end of your next turn, and you can choose the same or a different command from the list.

The suit’s air supply doubles as ballast to keep the wearer neutrally buoyant in water despite the armor’s weight, and the idiomatic design accommodates and protects the kalo’s swimming membranes. While the armor can be adapted to circulate water instead of air, kalos prefer their comfort of their own technology. Similarly, the filters and seals of kalo encounter suits can be adapted to the needs of air breathers, although such suits tend to accumulate excess moisture and develop mold or mildew.&nbsp;</span></p>"

Activating the fusion is a move action that binds the <em>tracking</em> fusion to the first creature you damage with the weapon before the start of your next turn. Once you track a target with this fusion, you are aware of the target’s location as long as it is within 1,000 feet and you keep the weapon with this fusion in hand.<br></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListWeaponFusions_ctl00_LabelName\">If the target is further away, you can attempt a Perception check (opposed by the target creature’s Stealth check) to know approximately what direction the creature is in, though not accurately enough to triangulate its exact location. This is considered a magic divination. The tracking effect is removed if the target travels more than 10 miles away from you, the target changes planes, the effect is dispelled, you fail a Perception check to know its general distance by 10 or more, or 24 hours have passed since you last damaged the target with this weapon. For the purposes of dispelling the tracking effect, treat the effect as a spell with a caster level equal to the weapon’s item level. You can track only one creature at a time. Activating the <em>tracking</em> weapon fusion again automatically ends any previous binding. Only attacks made by the weapon against a single target can benefit from this fusion.</span></p>"

The tool replicated must be 8th level or lower. The polyhand can replicate the moving parts of a tool, but you must supply any fuel or batteries needed for the tool to function. The tool cannot produce substances, and since it’s not very conductive (important so as to avoid shocking the user), it can’t serve as a power conduit or data transmission line. The GM has final say in deciding which tools you can duplicate. The tools within engineering kits and similar kits can be duplicated, subject to the restrictions above.<br>You can’t replace the hand setting based on your biology, which is required for the polyhand to function properly. You can add a hand corresponding to another species in any slot that isn’t reserved; for instance, a human could program her polyhand to replicate a shirren hand. This can’t duplicate features of a unique individual, such as thumbprints. You can install a polyhand into a prosthetic limb that replaces an arm as if the prosthetic were a natural arm.<br>The adamantine construction makes the polyhand extremely durable (see page 408 in Chapter 11 for more information about adamantine). This doesn’t change the amount of unarmed strike damage, no matter the form your polyhand is in. The polyhand can’t maintain structural integrity if extended too far, so it can’t assume a form more than one and a half feet long in any dimension. Consequently, it can’t extend your reach.</p>"

      "description": "<p>These electrically charged absorption plates can draw the force of an explosion toward you, dampening the effect for everyone else. When you are within the area of an explosion (such as that of a weapon with the explode special property or an area effect that deals damage and allows a Reflex save for half or no damage), you can activate the absorption shield as a reaction. If the explosion deals damage, you take 1-1/2 times as much damage (150%) and can’t attempt a saving throw against the explosion (or use evasion or improved evasion). Other creatures (and objects, if applicable) within the area take only half damage from the explosion (and can attempt to reduce the damage with a saving throw as normal).<br>This upgrade can be installed only in heavy or powered armor.</p>"
